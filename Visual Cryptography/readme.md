# Visual Cryptography - Users Manual
The image you want to cipher should be composed of two colours only, both of which can be of your choice.
In the files you can find a white-and-black image titled 'xyz.jpg' that was used when conducting tests.

In order for the program to work correctly you will need to specify both used colours' RGB codes in the main.py file.

Have fun!
